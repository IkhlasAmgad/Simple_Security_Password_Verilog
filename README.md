A security system that provides coded access to a secured area is developed. Once 
a 4-digit security code is stored in the system, access is achieved by entering the 
correct code on a keypad. The system consists of the security code logic, the code selection logic, and the keypad. The keypad is a standard numeric keypad.
Basic Operation
In setup, a 4-digit entry code is set into the memory. For entry, the code is entered 
one digit at a time on the keypad and converted to a BCD code for processing by the 
security code logic. If the entered code agrees with the stored code, the output 
activates the access mechanism and allows the door or gate, depending on the type 
of area that is secured, to be opened. If the entered code disagrees with the stored 
code, the alarm signal is produced. After three times wrong trials, the system is locked 
and must be restarted by the admin to operate again.
